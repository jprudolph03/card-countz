Notes

1. One part generates a new deck with params or random
2. displays card in one container
3. sidebar keeps table of info:  True Cout, Cards Left.
---------
"dealer" component is god.  holds state, api
  passes down card selection to cardContainer
  passes down cardcount to 'record keeper' component
CardContainer keeps cards
cards are the actual card itself...that component this will change to 'hand' so we can later add more blackjacky things
